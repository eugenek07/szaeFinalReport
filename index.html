<h1 align="middle">Abstract</h2>
<p>
	The Wind Tunnel Flow Simulator project is a modification to the skeleton code for HW4, Clothsim. We modify the pointmass system and turns them into moving particles. We attempt to simulate how these particles interact with each other,
  the environment and any objects in the tunnel in a physically accurate way. To do so, we implemented Position Based Fluids by Macklin and MÃ¼ller for the underlying wind simulation. To help visualize all these interactions better, we color the particles based on their speed and any collisions they have in the tunnel. All in all, the Wind Tunnel Flow Simulator will utilize a 3D environment
  with simulated air particle collisions to generate a heat map over the surface of different objects.
</p>
<br>

<h1 align="middle">Technical Approach</h2>
<h2 align="middle">Summary</h2>
<h3 align="middle">Particles</h3>
<p>
  To implement our project, we first modify the parameters within the <code>pointmass</code> struct. Each <code>pointmass</code> has Vector3D values: position, last_position, forces, and color. They also have values for density and pressure.
  Additionally, in order to aid with collision calculations, we store <code>last_velocity</code>, <code>temp_velocity</code>, <coder>delta_p</coder>, a list of its pointmass neighbors, <code>lambda</code>, <code>rho</code>, and <code>omega</code>. These values
  are used at each timestep to continuously update the pointmass positions. Additionally, spring connections between point masses have been removed. 
</p>
<h3 align="middle">Particle Rendering</h3>
<p>
  We found that the pointmass rendering approach of using GL Spheres caused too many efficiency and latency issues. We found that GL points were much more efficient and their size and color could also be modified.
</p>
<p>
  Particles are generated as a grid of particles laid out vertically. Within <code>main.cpp</code>, we add a loop in order to spawn in points as a grid every 10 iterations. This will allow us to simulate a constant stream of wind. 
</p>
<p>
  We added logic to ensure that particles would be deleted once they exit the boundaries of the wind tunnel. This is to ensure our pointmass array doesn't become too large. 
</p>

<h3 align="middle">Color</h3>
<p>
  The color of each particle is determined by its own velocity. Within the simulation file, we passed in the position and the velocity of the particles to the shader.
  In <code>phong.frag</code>, we estimated a max velocity and clamped the input velocity to be between the max velocity and 0 and put it as a fraction between 0 and 1.
  For example, if the input speed was very close to the max velocity, then the clamped number would be very close to 1.0. Using these numbers, we fed it into the r, g, and b attributes of the output color.
  We wanted green to represent low velocity and red to represent high velocity, so we put in this clamped number into <code>color.r</code> and put in <code>1 - </code> the clamped number into <code>color.g</code>, and we put the half point into <code>color.b</code>.
  We then faced an issue of how the color was changing for every object in the scene not just the wind particles. So, we included a boolean that tells whether the object is a sphere or a plane.
  If it is sphere or plane, it would just skip over the part of the code that changes color based on velocity.
</p>

<h3 align="middle">Particle Based Wind Simulation</h3>

<h3 align="middle">Simulation</h3>
<p>
  In order to facilitate air flow, we want to implement Navier-Stokes equations. However the Navier-Stokes equation is computationally difficult to implement, as such we will use a Position-based wind simulation with PointMasses as the particles.
  Adapting from HW4, the Cloth Struct handles all the pointmasses. 
  <br>
  We updated the Pointmass Struct to keep track of a list of their neighbors which we obtain using bounding boxes and hashing. Since we are CPU bound, we made the decision to sacrifice some physical accuracy for efficiency in compute by using Verlet Integration in addition to
  incompressibility, collision, viscosity and vorticity constraints to update the position of the <code>pointmass</code> at each time step.
</p>
<p>
  Incompressibility
  <br>
  <p>The incompressibility constraint applies a small change in position <span class="formula">&Delta;p<sub>i</sub></span> to keep the volume of the fluid constant. We estimate the density of each particle as <span class="formula">&rho;<sub>i</sub> = &Sigma;<sub>j</sub> m<sub>j</sub>W<sub>poly6</sub>(p<sub>i</sub> - p<sub>j</sub>, h)</span>, where <span class="formula">W<sub>poly6</sub>(||r||, h)</span> is as defined by Muller in Paricle-Based Fluid Simulation for Interactive Applications.
<p>We use the particle density <span class="formula">&rho;<sub>i</sub></span> and fluid's rest density <span class="formula">&rho;<sub>0</sub></span> to calculate a density constraint <span class="formula">C<sub>i</sub></span>:</p>
<p>
  We first calculate the scaling factor &lambda;<sub>i</sub> with epsilon as a relaxation parameter according to equation 11 in Macklin and Muller.
  <br>
  We then added artificial pressure with a fixed delta_p and small constants k and n according to equation 13 of Macklin and Muller to account for Tensile Instability and to prevent clumping.
  <br>
  Lastly to enforce incompressibility, we implement the formula in equation 14 of Macklin and Muller to update the position of the pointmass.
</p>
<p>
  Viscosity
  <p>Since we are dealing with air particles instead of fluids, viscosity does not play as much of a factor.
    <br>
    To implement viscosity we add an artificial viscosity calculation with a small constant c to get the new velocity according to equation 17 of Macklin and Muller. Since we are doing position based update using Verlet Integration, we update the position directly.
    
  </p>
</p>
<h3 align="middle">Color</h3>
<p>
  The <code>Vector3D Color</code> of each pointmass is dynamically tied to the speed of each particle. 
</p>
<h2 align="middle">Problems Encountered + How Tackled</h2>
<p>
  <p>CPU Limitation:</p>
  One problem encountered was sever lag whenever we rendered the point mass particles initially. We found that that was occurring because it took more computing power to render each of the GL Spheres.
  We modified this so that the GL Spheres were rendered as GL Points. Additionally, we had to ensure that the size of the GL Points matched the specificed parameters to ensure that their behavior was accurate in relation
  to their pointmass neighbors. 
</p>
<p>
  <p>Tuning Parameters</p>
  Another issue we encountered was how the behavior of the particles would change drastically according to the initial speed of the simulation. Through trial and error,
  we had to tune parameters even after fully implementing our collision logic in order to achieve the desired behavior from the simulation. Tuning took had a much larger impact on the movement of the particles than we expected and required a lot of time to get right.
</p>
<h2 align="middle">Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>
  One of the main lessons learned from this project is the difficulty associated with tuning parameters in order to achieve good results. 3D Simulations and particle relationships are extremely finicky and requires a time consuming process to 
  create good results. We had to go through multiple different iterations, modifying the speed of the particles and the amount of particles until we reached a more high quality simulation.  
</p>

<p>
  We also learnt the need to make trade-offs between physical accuracy and computational efficiency. Being CPU bound has been a new experience for us due to the sheer amount of compute required to render objects. As such we had to make many considerations such as using Verlet Integration or simplifying certain formulas to allow for smoother rendering.
</p>

<h1 align="middle">Results</h2>
<p>
  Following our initial plan of execution, the results show a successful implementation of the wind tunnel.
