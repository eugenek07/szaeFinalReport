<h2 align="middle">Summary of Accomplishments</h2>
<p>
	Currently, we have successfully modified the clothsim functionality to render a grid of particles instead of a mesh for the cloth. We modified the .json test files so that the grid
  is created vertically and changed the gravity value to allow the particles to move horizontally. We've removed the spring classes and their effect on the particles at the moment. To summarize
  our accomplishments, we've finalized our setup in transitioning the clothsim skeleton code to prepare the implementation of Navier-Stokes. 
</p>

<h2 align="middle">Preliminary Results</h2>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Pointmasses are rendered as GL points in a vertical grid</li>
    <li>Pointmasses move on the horizontal plane: gravity value modifed</li>
    <li>Spring connections between pointmasses and halfedge mesh rendering of cloth removed</li>
    <li>Navier-stokes file created</li>
    <li>Wind particles will collide with object, but initial implementation of Navier-stokes is not accurate</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<br>

<h2 align="middle">Reflection on Progress</h2>
<p>
  Currently, we believe that progress has been good, with our remaining two weeks, the main thing to implement is Navier Stokes, storage of collision information to affect color, and finally
  the continuous generation of points per time step to simulate wind. There were a few moments where we had to weigh different options we could take. For instance, we debated on whether to render the
  pointmasses as GL points or spheres. There were pros and cons to both sides, but for the sake of rendering and the efficiency of the simulation, we decided on proceeding with GL points.
