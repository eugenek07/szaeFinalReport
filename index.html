<h1 align="middle">Abstract</h2>
<p>
	The Wind Tunnel Flow Simulator project is a modification to the skeleton code for HW4, Clothsim. We modify the pointmass system and turns them into moving particles. We attempt to simulate how these particles interact with each other,
  the environment and any objects in the tunnel in a physically accurate way. To do so, we implemented Position Based Fluids by Macklin and MÃ¼ller for the underlying wind simulation. To help visualize all these interactions better, we color the particles based on their speed and any collisions they have in the tunnel. All in all, the Wind Tunnel Flow Simulator will utilize a 3D environment
  with simulated air particle collisions to generate a heat map over the surface of different objects.
</p>
<br>

<h1 align="middle">Technical Approach</h2>
<h2 align="middle">Summary</h2>
<h3 align="middle">Particles</h3>
<p>
  To implement our project, we first modify the parameters within the <code>pointmass</code> struct. Each <code>pointmass</code> has Vector3D values: position, last_position, forces, and color. They also have values for density and pressure.
  Additionally, in order to aid with collision calculations, we store <code>last_velocity</code>, <code>temp_velocity</code>, <coder>delta_p</coder>, a list of its pointmass neighbors, <code>lambda</code>, <code>rho</code>, and <code>omega</code>. These values
  are used at each timestep to continuously update the pointmass positions. Additionally, spring connections between point masses have been removed. 
</p>
<h3 align="middle">Particle Rendering</h3>
<p>
  We found that the pointmass rendering approach of using GL Spheres caused too many efficiency and latency issues. We found that GL points were much more efficient and their size and color could also be modified.
</p>
<p>
  Particles are generated as a grid of particles laid out vertically. Within <code>main.cpp</code>, we add a loop in order to spawn in points as a grid every 10 iterations. This will allow us to simulate a constant stream of wind. 
</p>
<p>
  We added logic to ensure that particles would be deleted once they exit the boundaries of the wind tunnel. This is to ensure our pointmass array doesn't become too large. 
</p>

<h3 align="middle">Color</h3>
<p>
  The color of each particle is determined by its own velocity. Within the simulation file, we passed in the position and the velocity of the particles to the shader.
  In <code>phong.frag</code>, we estimated a max velocity and clamped the input velocity to be between the max velocity and 0 and put it as a fraction between 0 and 1.
  For example, if the input speed was very close to the max velocity, then the clamped number would be very close to 1.0. Using these numbers, we fed it into the r, g, and b attributes of the output color.
  We wanted green to represent low velocity and red to represent high velocity, so we put in this clamped number into <code>color.r</code> and put in <code>1 - </code> the clamped number into <code>color.g</code>, and we put the half point into <code>color.b</code>.
  We then faced an issue of how the color was changing for every object in the scene not just the wind particles. So, we included a boolean that tells whether the object is a sphere or a plane.
  If it is sphere or plane, it would just skip over the part of the code that changes color based on velocity.
</p>

<h3 align="middle">Particle Based Wind Simulation</h3>

<h3 align="middle">Collisions</h3>
<p>
  In order to facilitate air flow, we used Navier-Stokes equations. Objects inside the tunnel and the wind-tunnel walls act as obstacles for the flow. 
</p>
<h3 align="middle">Color</h3>
<p>
  The <code>Vector3D Color</code> of each pointmass is dynamically tied to the speed of each particle. 
</p>
<h2 align="middle">Problems Encountered + How Tackled</h2>
<p>
  One problem encountered was sever lag whenever we rendered the point mass particles initially. We found that that was occurring because it took more computing power to render each of the GL Spheres.
  We modified this so that the GL Spheres were rendered as GL Points. Additionally, we had to ensure that the size of the GL Points matched the specificed parameters to ensure that their behavior was accurate in relation
  to their pointmass neighbors. 
</p>
<p>
  Another issue we encountered was how the behavior of the particles would change drastically according to the initial speed of the simulation. Through trial and error,
  we had to tune parameters even after fully implementing our collision logic in order to achieve the desired behavior from the simulation.
</p>
<h2 align="middle">Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>
  One of the main lessons learned from this project is the difficulty associated with tuning parameters in order to achieve good results. 3D Simulations and particle relationships are extremely finicky and requires a time consuming process to 
  create good results. We had to go through multiple different iterations, modifying the speed of the particles and the amount of particles until we reached a more high quality simulation.

<h1 align="middle">Results</h2>
<p>
  Following our initial plan of execution, the results show a successful implementation of the wind tunnel.
